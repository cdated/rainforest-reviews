Caterpillar” when I was small and I have always loved the sweet nature of this book","I remembered always reading “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” when I was small and I have always loved the sweet nature of this book. I still love this book to this very day! “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” is a popular children’s book by Eric Carle and it is about how a very hungry caterpillar starts eating everything in its path. “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” is truly a cute and extraordinary book about food that children will love for many years!<br /><br />Eric Carle has certainly done a great job at both illustrating and writing this book. What I really enjoyed about this book was Eric Carle’s illustrations as they are extremely colorful and cute. I love the way that Eric Carle illustrated the caterpillar having a green long body and a red head and Eric Carle also did a great job at putting a surprised expression on the caterpillar’s face when it first got out of its egg. I also love the illustrations of the caterpillar eating any food item that it comes across such as an apple and a piece of chocolate cake and you can see the cut out holes in the middle of the images of the food items indicating that the caterpillar ate through each food item. I definitely enjoyed Eric Carle’s story of the caterpillar as it details the caterpillar’s extreme hunger whenever it ate through so many food items. Eric Carle makes the story extremely cute and hilarious as the caterpillar literally eats twice its weight and I found myself laughing at the different types of food that the caterpillar ate. Many children will be awed at how much food the caterpillar, even I was surprised at how much food the caterpillar ate and I was not so surprised when the caterpillar had a stomachache, which will teach children about the importance of not overeating so much."

A  seemingly simple thought that occurred to me while reading a bedtime story to my two year old son . It resulted in two 3+ hour sessions, late into the night, adopting and abandoning multiple trains of logic/methodologies.  It required re-learning high school mathematics and analyzing the two dimensional pages of a great children’s book to assess the  three dimensional volume of illustrated food.<br /><br />Read and enjoy the below, because I am never getting that six 6 hours of my life back.<br /><br />Plus, my son's picture of Eric Carle's wonderful creation!<br /><br />Methodology: Assuming our caterpillar eats approximately his own body’s circumference through the items’ width/thickness (a simple caterpillar-sized tunnel through the food), I used pi and math to determine volumes of the foods and the size and volume of an average man and likely caterpillar.  I reviewed the size, shape, of each food item in the book as well as the location and angle from which the caterpillar purportedly burrowed.<br /><br />Result: The Very Hungry Daderpillar would eat (conservatively) 700 apples,1100 pears, 2100 plums, 3500 strawberries, 3600 oranges, 500 pieces of chocolate cake, 1300 ice cream cones, 1100 pickles, 3000 slices of swiss cheese, 6000 slices of salami, 6000 lollipops, 1400 slices of cherry pie, 1100 sausages, 700 cupcakes, 1000 slices of watermelon.<br /><br />More data here: [...]"

A simple book about a caterpillar, whatever that is, and its quest for food. What could possibly be wrong with this book. Well I'll tell you. What this book doesn't advertise the persuasive abilities for power. It turns whoever reads this book into a maniac driven mad by the revelation of the idea of hunger. Hitler himself had read this, and was too terrified from what he had seen. Let me delve into more detail.<br /><br />It was a sunny Friday afternoon, and I was at a pool party. This wasn't a party I was invited too, but I like kids, so I came anyways. The party was in celebration of some kid's 9th birthday party. Said kid was enjoying himself at the far end of the pool, while I hid in the shadows so no parents would notice I wasn't supposed to be there. I should probably say that this wasn't a public pool, but the parents' backyard. I would occasionally sneak some of the food that was laid out for the hungry kids, and maybe a soda or two.<br /><br />Before long it was time for presents, and every kid came rushing to the table area. The parents' neglected to take the kid's baby brother with them to the party place, so he was sitting reading a book. This book. My curiosity got the best of me and I tiptoed over to the kid to see what masterful piece of literature it was he was reading. I quickly tried to snatch the book from the young sap's hands, but my manly grip was no match for his iron hold. I had to act quick so nobody else would see me. I grabbed the whole child and bolted over the nearest fence. I ran as fast as my heart could stand, and didn't stop to rest for several blocks.<br /><br />After running a safe distance, I again tried to pry the curious read from the tough toddler's hands. Thankfully the crowbar I had worked just as well. With no more use of this child, I placed him on a nearby doorstep with a note attached reading 'Orphan Child. Please give good home.' and rang the doorbell. When someone came to the door, I had to explain the awkward situation, but they promised to do good by me. I was then able to prance home, guilt free, for a night of lavish luxury with my new companion, The Very Hungry Caterpillar.<br /><br />This was the sort of book in which you only required two things to begin reading it. A nice, warm fleece blanket in which you rely on in times of hardship and cling to no matter what, and a literate mind. Luckily one of my servants knew how to read so one out of two isn't terrible. As I sat there, sprawled on top of my bed, covered in beautiful women, my mind began to absorb all that Jos&eacute; was reading from the book. My mind tried to make sense of what was happening. This is what I gathered.<br /><br />In the beginning, there was but Caterpillar. Caterpillar was hungry, but there was naught. So Caterpillar said 'LET THERE BE,' and there was. Even though there was, Caterpillar was still hungry, and so there is. Caterpillar could never stop hungering. From an objective viewpoint, this was a problem. Caterpillar realized this problem and so became. It seemed finally that Caterpillar was no longer hungry.<br /><br />And so, as the story develops we manage to learn that Caterpillar is always hungry, and that always being hungry isn't a bad thing. Hunger is what drives us, making us ourselves. Without hunger we are only us, never I. All Caterpillar wants is more, but there never is more. More will never be, even though it is all we want. There is no more, just all there is.<br /><br />As I laid there, wedged between bodacious babes, my puny mind tried to process all this information. Then, the inevitable happened. I could feel them coming from miles away, but never thought that I would be unlucky enough to be affected. My mind blanked. All I could see was colors. At this point I was pretty sure I started screaming, because that's when all the gorgeous women ran, panicked. Jos&eacute; stayed.<br /><br />My body felt separate, but connected. I couldn't quite put my finger on what was happening, because I couldn't feel my fingers. My body stretched, which if you were watching, might seem cool. I could feel the pigments in my skin change from blue, to purple, to green, back to skin color, then back to green. My entire being started convulsing, my body splashing around like a beached aquaman. If only I had listened to Caterpillar.<br /><br />It was time. The transformation was almost complete. My head turned from a round shape into an even rounder shape. My arms became nonexistent as they turned into small, stubby feet. My legs shrank into my pelvis, which extended into smaller joints. I wriggled around. I am no longer me. I am now Caterpillar.<br /><br />Then I remembered I don't have a servant named Jos&eacute;.<br /><br />I woke up."

Carle uses clever cutout pages to depict a caterpillar eating his way through the calendar week. Caterpillar also brilliantly displays Carle’s ability to integrate a concept (days of the week), scientific information (the life cycle of a caterpillar), and an appealing story. (Ages 3-6)” –<br />--Judith Rovenger, Sesame Street Parents, July/August 1994<br /><br />“Carle's classic tale of a voracious caterpillar who eats his way through the days of the week and then changes into a beautiful butterfly has been reissued in a sumptuous twenty-fifth anniversary edition with a shiny, silver-coated cover and wonderfully thick, durably pages.”<br />--The Horn Book Guide Volume VI, Number 1 July-December 1994<br />“Every child should experience this wonderful, cumulative story, with its brightly coloured pictures of the tiny but greedy caterpillar that eats his way through one apple, two plums and three pears before turning into a beautiful butterfly. The board version stands up well to the inevitable poking of little fingers through the holes in the pages.” (2-4 yrs)<br />  --Kirkus UK<br /><br />If this review was helpful please select the ‘yes’ button below"

The innovative design in the original is here as well (holes in the pages, different page lengths).  My kids love it.  Their favorite part is the one where the caterpillar eats through 10 different kinds of food.  In fact, they always fight over it.  The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a timeless story for kids everywhere.  It teaches them about animals, science, food, counting and good habits.  Get it!"

He builds a cocoon and then emerges a large beautiful butterfly. My 3 year old does not tire of this story. He learns about nature, food and the days of the week in one absolutely stunningly illustrated book. You can't get much better than this for young children.

Today when we are feeding ourselves in usually unhealthy way, book message that fruits and vegetables should be eaten regularly is more than welcome for teaching younger generations.<br /><br />Together with great and educating text book immediately will win your hearts due to its appearance and beautiful illustrations that were made with using cut and layered collages and then overprinted with ink, crayon, and tempura.

I have adopted the tradition of buying classic children's stories and fairy tales to gift friends who are pregnant or have children of their own.  Because of the popularity and relatively unchanged look of this story, it is considered a classic and can be quite expensive in book stores (hence, me buying this on Amazon.com).  The book is available in several different formats but I always buy hardcover books for children as my hope is they will weather little hands.  It has 32 pages with several half, third, and quarter pages as the caterpillar begins to eat through fruits and vegetables; bright, colorful illustrations, and a bound bead-board white cover (note: this cover can get dirty quickly!).  The book is approximately 9&#34; x 12&#34; and has a wonderful message and story."

He flips the pages for me and does not want me to turn the pages. When I get to the pages where the catterpillar eats apples/orages/starawbaey, there is a hole in the middle of the fruits that it eats. He tries to stick his tiny finger into it and delights. At the end where the catterpillar turns into the butterfly, my son wides his hand and mimics that it turned into butterflys. He really enjoys the book very much. I have this book for him almost three month, he still loves it. Its a great book. Its a short book which is good for his age as he has a short attention span."

I BOUGHT THE BOARD BOOK, NOT HARDCOVER!<br /><br />To start, I bought this book for admittedly odd reasons. My daughter is a 'pig,' she is about to have a butterfly party and I needed about $4 more to get free shipping. I knew of this classic, but didn't remember it.<br /><br />SIZE/STYLE: It isn't a bad size at all!? It says 5x7 and I didn't measure it, but I think that's about what it is. Micro? Smaller than a dollar bill? No, but those reviews I saw were from 2009 on the hard cover version which is more money. So if it really was that small, yeah, rip-off! This one is just right for little hands and I actually prefer to buy board books because I don't like ripped pages!<br /><br />STORY: I was very impressed with the learning of the book. Counting, days of the week, and what the caterpillar should be eating!<br /><br />BOOK: I loved the little tabs in the book to bring the kids into it, and the holes in the pages like the caterpillar ate it!<br /><br />Very happy with this purchase. Just over $5 for a classic book that had neat features for young kids!"

This book tells the story of a caterpillar who eats holes through various fruits and other food items.  In the end, he turns into a butterfly.  This is a simple story with few words. The illustrations are nice.  There are holes in the pages where the caterpillar has eaten through the food item, which is a nice touch that amuses children. This can be used as a bedroom or nursery theme for a baby or child.  Matching bedding and decor can be found at Pottery Barn or online.

It is shocking then to learn that over 6% of individuals dealing with anorexia and over 1% of individuals battling bulimia are in fact, male. Boys too, it seems, are dieing to be thin. In his book The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Eric Carle addresses the roots of male eating nervosa from parental abandonment to the growing 'hunger' for love and acceptance. He addresses the patterns of binge and fast that so aptly marks the male patterns of this disease while addressing the ever looming image of bodily perfection, 'the beautiful butterfly.'

I know the description states 'giant board book and plush package' but again, the picture does not match the description so I was curious as to which item I would receive.  I was looking for a large board book without the handle, because the handle is not very sturdy and arrived bent/damaged.

Got it new because i'm having my first baby in July and i wanted to make sure its something i'd feel comfortable with him putting in his mouth. For some reason i couldnt do that with an older book- even if it was in good condition."

Remember poking my fingers through the holes in the food and imagining the hungry Caterpillar doing so as well.  Lovely surprise at the end.  I like the fact that it's a board book, which gives strength to the pages while trying to put your fingers into the holes.  But with a board book, the pictures are smaller.  I don't know that it's a problem, if the child has never experienced otherwise."

It was one of my favorite books just because of all the color inside and the beautiful illustrations. The best part of this book was that there were holes in it. The holes weren't there because the book was ripped and old, but they were there to represent the bites the caterpillar would take out of each food.<br /> This book is very good for children because it teaches them many things. It teaches them the days of the week, different types of food and it also teaches them that a caterpillar eventually turns into a beautiful butterfly. This book is an excellent choice for children and it most certainly will catch their eye because of the elaborate colors on each page of the book."

It is a delightful book and simple so children soon learn the words to use it as a pre-reader using picture clues for the words. It also teaches about the way a butterfly starts as an egg and ends up after two other steps a butterfly.

His artful illustrations are truely his own unique style and separate him from others. And when you hear his name, there's one book that i'm pretty sure all people have heard: 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar'.<br />In the book, we see a newly-hatched caterpillar on a Sunday morning, who is as hungry as a horse. On Monday, he eats through an apple. On Tuesday, he eats through two pears. On Wednesday, he eats through three plums. On Thursday, he eats through four strawberries. On Friday, he eats through five oranges. But on Saturday, when he has a giant picnic feast, he gets more than a hunger pain.<br />No matter what, this has been one of the first books we all read as toddlers. They will love its artful looks, the holes in the books, and the early lessons. They'll learn the days of a whole week, counting from 1-5, and how to eat healthy and not eat too much unhealthy food.

My daughter in law remembered it from when she was little.  This was one of her all time favorites.  It's about a caterpiller eating everything until he gets big and fat and turns into a butterfly.  The colors are nice.  It's cute that pages have holes in them showing how many things the caterpiller ate on that page."

So I thought it would be fun to buy a famous book like this, and I bought it a couple months ago. Now, I'm not much of a book reader, but I gotta say, I could not put this book down! It's a nice story about a catapiller that has lots of suspense in the middle, when he gets stuck in the cocoon. Who are the bad guys who trapped him in the cocoon??? You have to read it to find out.  It also has some magical 'science fiction' stuff where (SPOILER ALERT!) the catapiller escapes from the cocoon and somehow turns into a butterfly. That was a plot twist that really caught me by surprise!<br /><br />This book is sturdy, and has pages made of nice thick cardboard. So it's perfect for me to bring on the bus to read on my way to work. Now, I've got a question for all you 'Hungrey Catapiller' fans out there: is this supposed to be a comedy book? Because whenever I read it on the bus, people around me look at the book, then look at me and start to laugh, like there's a 'inside joke' in the book. But I never thought it was a funny book, just a suspenseful mystery. Maybe I just don't get the jokes, I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend this book to readers of all ages! Even when my daughter comes to my house on her court-ordered visitation, she will pick up the Hungrey Catapiller book and understand some of it. She likes it almost as much as her coloring books. So it appeals to Kids, too.<br /><br />I wish I could give this book more than '5 Stars'! I also wish I could feed the Catapiller, so he wouldn't be so hungry anymore."

We were all fascinated by this colorful book about a caterpillar who eats his way through a lot of food, then becomes a butterfly. Until the last couple of months, I hadn't picked up the book since 1990. But when I saw it at the store, I got it off the shelf to read to my daughter, and see if she liked it as much as I did then. Sure enough, she did. This is just a charming little book. It might not be much of a story book for bed time or anything, but it's definitely a neat one to look at.<br /><br />The book is just a few pages long, but it tells the short story about a hungry little caterpillar who isn't satisfied when he eats a lot of fruit, so he moves on to snacks and what most people consider junk food, which makes him huge. The caterpillar then makes its cocoon, and emerges as a beautiful butterfly.<br /><br />This book is for very young children, as you can see by the reading level in the product details here. It's best for babies to pre-schoolers, though it was quite fine with a kindergarten class too. Unless you're in an area that has a lot of caterpillars and butterflies, some kids aren't exposed to them much or know that caterpillars tun into butterflies, so this is a great book to show that. And like I stated above, the artwork is fantastic. Eric Carle has a very distinct style, going with tissue paper rather than pencil, ink or paint. Simple things like a hot dog or plum look great in their own right with this style, and even now as a hopeful children's book author, I admire this artwork. I also love how the caterpillar shows no emotion, except for when its eaten too much and you can tell he has a pretty bad tummy ache.<br /><br />But there is one thing that's throwing off a lot of people who order this book, and it's the same thing that happened to me with The Very Busy Spider. Only in the product details do you see the size of the book listed. Most people would assume that these books are your more regular book size, rather than a mini version that fits in your back pocket. Sometimes the edition of the book isn't mentioned in the item title either, so please read the product details before placing an order so you don't end up disappointed when a tiny book arrives.<br /><br />The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a book that most children will enjoy, and is a nice one to look at in the car, grocery shopping, or as a prep for a bigger bedtime book. Eric Carle just has that magic touch of making simple, short stories that are memorable for years to come...with a big help from colorful tissue paper!"

The following Sunday he spins a cocoon and goes to sleep, waking as a beautiful butterfly.  This wonderful book has a lot going for it: It utilizes the days of the week, counts from one to five, names a number of familiar foods, and traces the life cycle of a caterpillar.  It also incorporates a charming humor when on Saturday, the caterpillar eats many foods beloved by small children (but not by caterpillars), and develops a stomachache.  There is also a tactile element for younger readers, because as the caterpillar eats through each food he leaves a hole in the page, which is a cutaway revealing additional foods to come on the next day.  The plot is simple enough to hold the attention of the toddlers for whom it is intended, while providing enough complexity to last longer than most toddler stories.  It's brightly illustrated in Carle's inimitable collage style.<br /><br />Because of its immense popularity, the book has appeared in many editions -- including board book, paperback, foam book, and pop-up.  Since the 0-4 age is very rough on books, I recommend the sturdier versions."

It came in a beautiful, beautiful big box with lovely thick glowing pages, a treasure for a classroom. (The only negative might be that I have to repeatedly do this from my own pocket with California continuing to disgrace public education in its lack of funding  and the national sideshow to keep teacher's pounded while they do exactly that, get what they need out of their teacher's pocket, most often with no thanks. Or worse while treating them disrespectfully. However it's just to be expected now I suppose.)<br /><br />That said this is just beautiful.<br />It is a book about transformation. I am a 1st grade teacher delighted to be able to use it as I develop lessons for my class. What is happening, of course, is that they are taking the stories read to them not long ago and then reading them to one another and beginning their journey into literacy with books like this. It is, as Carle said in a tape I own of him discussing his book making,  of his making, easing the journey from home to school, making it more comfortable and a better experience.<br /><br />This story of the caterpillar munching away teaches on so many levels, formal and informal- from love of color, to fascination with the holes( the gimmick if you will), from the life cycle of this butterfly, to the days of the week, the idea of change...it's rich with possibilities and spawned the idea for derivative books my class is making this week and many joyful moments acting out and reading the text.<br /><br />Who might want such a big book?<br />It's a great thing to donate to a primary teacher, I'd have loved it when my children were young, it might be a really exciting gift to a family with several youngsters 1 to 7 in age that might enjoy a really exciting special big gift, something that celebrates books, perhaps combined with a butterfly kite. That would be just a great combination if someone could afford it. You'd be giving something extraordinary. (And it could then one day rest with their children.)<br /><br />Carle is among my favorite writers for younger children, and make no mistake, what appears simple and so easy is the product of someone that has done their personal work to a very high level. Distilled something to an essence. That this is 40 years old amazes me. It's the year to say, 'thank you Eric Carle' for a wonderful contribution to literacy."

Thanks to this book they now also know that caterpillars spin a cocoon also known as a chrysalis, and when the caterpillar sleeps in his cocoon he will come out a beautiful butterfly.

"1199","20051204","","5","2","3","on December 4, 2005","AOG3FF20B7G7M","Literary Critique","Eric Carle's The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a classic story that has been enjoyed by children all over the world since it was published in 1969.  This is a story that is aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  Through Carle's unique illustrations and die-cut images, the reader's attention is immediately grabbed when opening the first page to this fascinating story.  The Very Hungry Caterpillar is also very educational.  The text teaches readers the process that a caterpillar goes through to become a butterfly.  It also teaches readers the importance of a healthy diet.<br /><br />  Eric Carle has a great respect for children and their education. 'I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun' (The Official Eric Carle Website). All of Eric Carle's books have a lesson that all children can learn from.  Carle has a very strong love for nature, and feels that it is important to communicate that to his readers.  Carle uses animals as characters for most of his books.  Many subject areas that are found in Carle's books include: Science, Math, Health, Reading, and Art.<br /><br />  The Very Hungry Caterpillar story starts out in the middle of the night.  The caterpillar is only an egg sitting on a leaf.  One Sunday morning, a very hungry caterpillar popped out of the egg.  The caterpillar wanted to eat, and decided to look for some food.  Each day, the caterpillar eats more and more food.  Finally, the caterpillar becomes very big and fat, and decides to build a cocoon around him.  The caterpillar stayed inside the cocoon for more than two weeks.  Finally, he nibbled his way through the cocoon, and out came a beautiful butterfly.<br /><br />The genre of The Very Hungry Caterpillar can be classified as fantasy since caterpillars do not eat the same foods that the very hungry caterpillar does in this story.  In the story, the caterpillar falls into a dilemma of his own when he gets too fat.  He then resolves this problem by building a cocoon and then forming into a butterfly.<br /><br />  The Very Hungry Caterpillar is an example of a good piece of children's literature.  According to the temple text, a good piece of children's literature must expand awareness.  The Very Hungry Caterpillar teaches the readers about caterpillars and how they transform into butterflies. A good piece of children's literature must also provide an enjoyable read that doesn't overly teach of moralize.  In The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Carle tells an enjoyable story about a caterpillar and the funny foods that he eats.  While children enjoy laughing out loud to the caterpillar's eating habits, they are able to learn the importance of healthy eating.  This book is also full of quality.  Although it is not as poetic as Carle's other books, the plot is somewhat convincing, and the description is entertaining.  The Very Hungry Caterpillar shows a lot of originality as well.  We are not only able to see this through the text, but through Carle's vivid illustrations, and die cut holes.<br /><br />  There are several classroom connections for The Very Hungry Caterpillar.  Science, counting, pattern sequences, and days of the week are all classroom connections found in this story.  As a teacher, you can explain to your class how the caterpillar transforms from an egg, to a caterpillar, to a butterfly.  Teachers can then have your students draw the steps out on a piece of paper.  Teachers can conduct a math lesson using the different foods that the caterpillar eats.  Teachers can even have their students create their very own Eric Carle Art.  There are so many different lessons that can come out of this wonderful story that children can benefit from.  Eric Carle books are a must have in every elementary school teacher's classroom."

My role was to be the one of a pear...who had been eaten by a worm.  A very hungry worm at that.<br />I am now a theatre director, and I must say it was thanks to this little book with a great apetite that I have gone as far as I am!<br />decades after reading this book, it still brings joy to me; I would recomend it to any child."
"1221","20020908","","5","2","3","on September 8, 2002","ANONYMOUS","A marvelous, enjoyable little book","My 2 year old, long a fan of Carle's Brown Bear Brown Bear, LOVES the Very Hungry Caterpillar.  The story is simple and delightful and fun to read.  The pages are ingeniously designed to reveal yet ANOTHER item the very hungry caterpillar ate every day... and the belly ache he gets after eating every possible wrong food (wrong for caterpillars) really made an impact on my daughter, who talks freely about 'very hungry caterpillar ate too much!'  The book also beautifully illustrates in simple terms the metamorphoses of the caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly.  It's a bargain and a great, classic read!"

A must have for kids!","In my opinion this is on the short list of must have books for kids!<br />The text is lovely. The pictures are adorable. The story line is funny and still based on fact. An egg hatches and out comes a hungry caterpillar who eats her way through everything. One day when she has had enough to eat, she makes a cacoon and comes out a lovely butterfly.<br />The bright pictures that fit in with the words and the predictability make this a good book for pre readers. The rythm to the words make this a fun book to read.<br />Enjoy."

Now I read it to my own son, who is 8 months old. While I enjoy Eric Carle's style and collages, I find that some of his more recent books are disappointing. The stories aren't that great, and the collages aren't as unique. But The Very Hungry Caterpillar exceeds his more recent works in its simplicity. Children love to look at all of the food the caterpillar ate through, and the story (about a natural process of the caterpillar turning into a butterfly) is depicted in such a fresh manner. I have also purchased some other Eric Carle books, but this one is a must have. It's a classic."

The story is simple, the illustrations are gorgeous and the holes in the pages are irresistible to little fingers!  One tip: for young readers the board book is definitely the way to go.  Not only is it more robust (I got sick of sellotaping the paperback pages back together), but it is very satisfying for my son to poke his fingers through the holes and have me poke mine back from the other side.  This book was my salvation on a 4 hour plane trip!"
"1226","20020702","","5","3","18","on July 2, 2002","AMDNJNZ6DRKUP","Children's classic","Another great story from Carle.  His illustrations are always fantastic, but his stories can be erratic.  This on is a dead-on hit.  It is the brief story of a caterpillar's feeding frenzy before he makes his metamorphosis into a butterfly.  The book introduces children to the days of the week, the names of fruits, and numbers as the caterpillar eats through different foods each day --two pears on Tuesday, three plums on Wednesday, etc.-- until he finally weaves his cocoon and emerges as a beautiful butterfly.  This story is a hit every time.  Carle's bright colors and clever die-cut artwork never cease to entertain even the youngest child, and there is surely nothing in nature closer to magic than the emergence of a butterfly.  This is a beautiful and fun book that will enthrall any child."

I do recommend the hardcover version, only because it will be well-handled if your children are anything like mine were. They will be compelled to stick their fingers in the holes left by that peskily hungry caterpillar, who eats his way through everything in sight!<br />The caterpillar's face is just captivating. I love it. And he eats, and he eats and he eats...and at the very very end, he becomes a beautiful butterfly! It's just the best illustration of metamorphosis in the world. But I have to warn all scientifically oriented parents out there: My two children were singularly UNimpressed with the butterfly and the fact that the caterpillar had become this beautiful creature! They liked him just as he was! Go figure, right? For whatever reason, they--and I--adored this book."

He's a &#34;hungy catpillar&#34; nut (how it happened, we aren't exactly sure), but it was so cute to watch him &#34;read&#34; through this on his own. (He's 3 now so his reading is just him flipping pages and saying words). I like that the pictures are colorful and pretty. All around, it's a highly recommended gift for any toddler that might like fun colors and pictures."

I wasn't sure as lately he's been off books and only wanting to play cars but this book appealed - perhaps because of the food? He loves to go through it and say the names of the fruit and then read off all the different things the caterpillar ate.  Classic book - guess that's why - still appeals to children and will for years to come I'm sure.  Love it and recommend it. Love the board book version too - good strong pages!"

It has everything a child could ask for when it comes to a grabbing story, creative illustrations, and it teaches your children what the days of the week are in a fun and different style from what most readers are accustom to.  Eric Carle is a brilliant writer and illustrator for his genre.  He has written over seventy children books but The Very Hungry Caterpillar is his most famous children’s book.  Since it’s publishing in 1969 it has been translated into sixty-two different languages and sold forty-one million copies.  I read this book as a child, as did many others, and I am still blown away by the extravagant illustrations.<br />This children’s book is nothing like anything you are use to.  Eric Carle is not a tradition author/ illustrator in the sense that he just writes the book, draws the pictures to coincide with the story and calls it a day.  Eric Carle uses everything in the book, including cutting pages to really get his message across and keep the reader/ children interested.  In The Very Hungry Caterpillar the pages start out the same length but then get very small and gradually get to back to the original size.  This helps keep the children’s attention.  As the pages turn you will see the Caterpillar climbing threw the holes in the food he just made and continue on to the next day.  The imagery in this book are breathe taking.  Eric Carle multiple forms of art to give his images life and make the pictures of food look appetizing.  This books express’s Eric Carle’s talents.<br />Along with teaching children the days of the week this book also teaches the stages of life of this caterpillar.  It starts out, “In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf” (Carle).  Before you eyes you will see this egg turn into a caterpillar.  The caterpillar will eat and eat until it is time to make a cocoon and sleep.  The climax of this book is in his cocoon, the caterpillar transforms, “he was a beautiful butterfly” (Carle).<br />For teachers/ parents who will read this book to their children, a creative activity would be to have your children make some Eric Carle styled art.  The kids will love the bright colors and getting their hands dirty.  Another fun/ educational activity is to get the kids caterpillars and have them watch as the caterpillar transforms from its larva form, to a cocoon and then finally a butterfly.  This will give the children a real life experience to relate to the book.  After reading this book teachers/ parents might want to ask the children if the understood theme of this book.  If they understood the growth of the caterpillar and that over time he changed similar to how over time, people will change.  Another question you might want to ask is if after hearing this story, do the children remember what the days of the week are.  Another activity a teacher/ parents can do it read some of Eric Carle’s other works, such as The Very Lonely Firefly or The Very Busy Spider.  Both are amazing books that will help support children in their early years.  The Very Lonely Firefly tells a story of a firefly that is lonely but eventually finds friends and The Very Busy Spider tells a tale of a spider who works very hard until her achieves his goal by completing his web.<br />For those who want to know more (children, parents and teachers) about Eric Carle and his work, a great place to look is his official website, http://www.eric-carle.com.  This will give readers a background to Eric Carle, his books and his museum.  Another great website to gather more information would be the museums facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/CarleMuseum/.  This website will give readers updates about his museum, books and other events related to Eric Carle.<br />The Very Hungry Caterpillar is Eric Carle’s best work.  You, your students/ children will truly enjoy it.  I’m sure that the hungry caterpillar will eat his way through the pages and into your heart as he did for me when I was a young child."

Mixing salami with a lollipop, cake, ice cream and watermelon just doesn't make for a great outcome. But on Sunday, he eats another green leaf and feels much better. I think that says a lot about how important it is to eat good things. It's also fun to see how many of the colorful things the catepillar ate wind up as the color of his wings.

A young caterpillar is bornand begins to eat his way through the world and through many foods that you child will be able to identify. These foods are eaten on each of the seven days of the week, an added bonus, as your child begins to learn that Sunday is a different day that Monday. The caterpillar gets very fat. He builds a cocoon and then emerges a large beautiful butterfly. My 3 year old does not tire of this story. He learns about nature, food and the days of the week in one absolutely stunningly illustrated book. You can't get much better than this for young children. If you have young children, or if you are looking for a gift for a 4 year old and younger child, this book is highly, highly recommended. Enjoy."

This board book is heavy duty and my kid loves to chew on it and drool on it when we aren't reading together (and sometimes when we are). The illustrations are amazing and are very colorful and high contrast to help keep babies attention.<br /><br />I am not sure if this is how the paper book is, but the board book has little tiny pages once the caterpillar starts eating and then each page gets bigger as the caterpillar eats more.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for babies. It is fun to read and the kids enjoy listening."

I like this book because I can make up stories about the pictures on their own and it allowed me to talk to my baby longer rather than just coo and gaa at him.  Now that he is 14 months old, we continue to read the book together and he can now point to certain items if I call them out.  Very cute book.  FYI for Massachusetts residents, I recently discovered an Eric Carle museum.  I haven't been there yet but if you read the book to your child, then go to the museum (or vice versa) it gives the child a chance to connect things and further learn through books."

Will probably be a classic.","This book is bound to become a classic like `Goodnight Moon.'  It's a simple story of a little caterpillar who eats his way through a variety of foods, all the way through an apple and finally all the way through ten different snacks including an ice cream cone and a pickle; he gets an upset stomach, but he eats his way through a nice green leaf and is cured. But now he's a big, fat caterpillar and spins himself a cocoon and ultimately pushes out at a butterfly!<br /><br />The illustrations of the foods he eats his way through each have hole in the page and my little two-year old relative happily pushes his finger into each hole and is learning to count. It gives him an activity when the book is read to him. He and his father enjoy it because of the little drama and overacting they can do as the story progresses.  It's a really fine book for a two-year old.<br /><br />The book itself is printed on heavy, coated card stock and the illustrations are charming."
